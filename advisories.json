Any modern kernel will zero out new memory pages before handing them off to a process. This means that only memory previously used and deallocated by the node process can be leaked.\n1. Node.js manages Buffers by creating a few large internal SlowBuffers, and slicing them up into smaller Buffers which are made accessible in JS. They are not stored on V8's heap, because garbage collection would interfere.

The client (which could in fact be the server in certain instances) is that one that allocates and sends the memory that is then echo'd by the server.\n\nA vulnerability was found in the ping functionality of the ws module which allowed clients to allocate memory by sending a ping frame. The ping functionality by default responds with a pong frame and the previously given payload of the ping frame. \n\nThis is exactly what you expect, but internally ws always transforms all data that we need to send to a Buffer instance and that is where the vulnerability existed. ws didn't do any checks for the type of data it was sending. With buffers in node when you allocate it when a number instead of a string it will allocate the amount of bytes.\n\n```\nvar x = new Buffer(100);\n// vs\nvar x = new Buffer('100');\n```\n\nThis would allocate 100 bytes of memory in the first example and just 3 bytes with 100 as value in the second example. So the client would allocate 100 bytes of non-zeroed buffer and send that to the server. \n\n\n\n## Example POC\n```\nvar ws = require('ws')\n\nvar server = new ws.Server({ port: 9000 })\nvar client = new ws('ws://localhost:9000')\n\nclient.on('open', function () {\n  console.log('open')\n  client.ping(50) // this sends a non-zeroed buffer of 50 bytes\n\n  client.on('pong', function (data) {\n    console.log('got pong')\n    console.log(data) // Data from the client. \n  })\n})\n```","recommendation":"Update to version 1.0.1 or greater.","references":"- https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases/tag/1.0.1","legacy_slug":null,"allowed_scopes":["admin","public","early"],"cvss_vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","cvss_score":6.5},{"id":66,"created_at":"2015-12-28T18:37:19.938+00:00","updated_at":"2016-04-20T17:53:55+00:00","title":"SQL Injection due to unescaped object keys","author":"Sébastian Dejonghe","module_name":"mysql","publish_date":"2015-12-28T18:37:37.178+00:00","cves":[],"vulnerable_versions":"<=v2.0.0-alpha7","patched_versions":">=v2.0.0-alpha8","slug":"mysql_sql-injection-due-to-unescaped-object-keys","overview":"Keys of objects are not escaped with `mysql.escape()` which could lead to SQL Injection.","recommendation":"Update to the latest version of the mysql module.
