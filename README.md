# ls-vertretungsplan-desktop
UNOFFICIAL Desktop App for the schedule of Lornsenschule, Schleswig

# Info about the API
This Desktop App uses an API by @johan12345 that is NOT managed by me. I am allowed to use it and to have it in the Git Source. To see the APP made by @johan12345 take a look at https://ls.vertretungsplan.me

# How to Build (If you find the URL to the API ^^)

1. Clone the Repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. If You use Windows run `build.cmd` otherwise go to 4
4. Everybody else go into the app directory and run `npm install` and now run `node build.js` in the root
