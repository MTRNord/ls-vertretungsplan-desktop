# ls-vertretungsplan-desktop
UNOFFICIAL Desktop App for the schedule of Lornsenschule, Schleswig

# NOT WORKING FOR YOU YET!!!!!!
This Desktop App uses an API by @johan12345 that is NOT managed by me! I don't have the right to use it here so I don't provide the link to it or an compiled version of it.

# How to Build (If you find the URL to the API ^^)

1. Clone the Repository
2. Run `npm install`
3a. If You use Windows run `build.cmd`
3b. Everybody else go into the app directory and run `npm install` and now run `node build.js` in the root
